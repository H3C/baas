Hyperledger Cello is a blockchain provision and operation system, which helps manage blockchain networks in an efficient way.

## Introduction
Using Cello, everyone can easily:

* Build up a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform quickly from scratch.
* Provision customizable Blockchains instantly, e.g., a Hyperledger fabric network v1.0.
* Maintain a pool of running blockchain networks on top of baremetals, Virtual Clouds (e.g., virtual machines, vsphere Clouds), Container clusters (e.g., Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes).
* Check the system status, adjust the chain numbers, scale resources... through dashboards.

A typical usage scenario is illustrated as:

## Main Features
* Manage the lifecycle of blockchains, e.g., create/start/stop/delete/keep health automatically.
* Support customized (e.g., size, consensus) blockchains request, currently we mainly support [Hyperledger fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric).
* Support native Docker host, swarm or Kubernetes as the worker nodes. More supports on the way.
* Support heterogeneous architecture, e.g., X86, POWER and Z, from bare-metal servers to virtual machines.
* Extend with monitor, log, health and analytics features by employing additional components.

## Documentation, Getting Started and Develop Guideline
For new users, it is highly recommended to read the [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) or [index](docs/index.md) first.

And feel free to visit the [online documentation](http://cello.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information. You can also run `make doc` to start a local documentation website (Listen at [localhost:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## Why named Cello?
Can you find anyone better at playing chains? :)
