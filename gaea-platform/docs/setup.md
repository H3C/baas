# Setup Cello Platform

Cello follows a typical Master-Worker architecture. There are two types of Nodes in the cluster.

* `Master Node`: Holds [Cello services](service_management.md) to manage (e.g., `create/delete`) the chains inside Worker Nodes through Worker's management APIs. Usually, Master Node provides web dashboard (port `8080`) and RESTful APIs (port `80`). It is recommended to use Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 16.04+) or MacOS;
* `Worker Node`: Nodes to hold blockchains. Cello support several types of `worker node` from single server to cluster. Take `Docker host` or `Swarm cluster` for example, the Worker's management APIs (i.e., Docker daemon APIs) should be accessible (typically on port `2375`) from the Master Node.

## Master Node

See [Setup a Master Node](setup_master.md)

## Worker Node

Currently we support Docker Host or Swarm Cluster as Worker Node. More types will be added soon.

* `Docker Host`: [Setup Docker Host as a Worker Node](setup_worker_docker.md).
* `Docker Swarm `: [Create a Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/).
* `Kubernetes`: [Kubernetes Setup](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/).
* `vSphere`: [Setup vSphere as a Worker Node](setup_worker_vsphere.md).
* `Ansible`: [Setup Ansible as a Worker Node](setup_worker_ansible.md).

## Special Configuration for Production

Here we describe the setups for development usage. If you want to deploy Cello for production, please also refer to the [Production Configuration](production_config.md).
