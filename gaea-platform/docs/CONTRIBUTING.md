# Contribution
Any kind of contribution is encouraged, e.g., [Jira items](https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/CE/issues) or [patchsets](https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/cello).

## LF ID Application

All the tools require an Linux Foundation (LF) ID.

If you do not have an LF ID, can [apply one](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org) for free.

## Jira board usage

We are using [Jira](https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/CE) to track the project progress, and welcome to report bug issues or create to-do tasks there. Each item should try keeping simple and focused, hence easy to fix and review.

After login with your LF ID, you can see those task items with one of the following statuses:

* `To Do`: Available for picking and fix.
* `In Progress`: Some on already picked it (check the assignee) to work on.
* `Under Review`: Related patchset has been submitted for review, and added as comment under the Jira item.
* `Done`: Patchset merged, the item has been resolved.

In brief, if you want to contribute, create or find some `To Do` item, and assign it to yourself, then update its status to `In Progress`. After the item is fixed, remember to mark it as `Under Review` and `Done` when the patch is submitted and merged.

## Questions and discussions

* [RocketChat](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello): technical discussions and questions, login with your LFID.

## Code Commit Steps

The project employs [Gerrit](https://gerrit.hyperledger.org) as the code commit/review system.

*Before committing code, please go to [Jira](https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/CE) to create a new task or check if there's related existing one, then assign yourself as the assignee. Notice each task will get a Jira number like [CE-26](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-26).

* Clone the project to your working directory with your `LFID`.

```sh
$ git clone ssh://LFID@gerrit.hyperledger.org:29418/cello && scp -p -P 29418 LFID@gerrit.hyperledger.org:hooks/commit-msg cello/.git/hooks/
```

(Optionally) Config your git name and email if not setup previously.

```sh
$ git config user.name "your name"
$ git config user.email "your email"
```

(Optionally) Setup git-review by inputting your LFID. Notice this is only necessary once.
```sh
$ git review -s
```

* Assign yourself a `To Do` Jira task, mark it as `In progress`, then create a branch with the Jira task number off of your cloned repository, e.g., for CE-26, it can be:

```sh
$ cd cello
$ git checkout -b CE-26
```

* After modifying the code, run `make check` to make sure all the checking is passed. Then Commit your code with `-s` to sign-off, and `-a` to automatically add changes (or run `git add .` to include all changes manually).

```sh
$ make check
  ...
  py27: commands succeeded
  py30: commands succeeded
  py35: commands succeeded
  flake8: commands succeeded
  congratulations :)

$ git commit -s -a
```

Example commit msg may look like:

```sh
[CE-26] A short description of your change with no period at the end

You can add more details here in several paragraphs, but please keep each line
width less than 80 characters. A bug fix should include the issue number.

Fix https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/CE-26.

Change-Id: If2e142ea1a21bc4b42f702f9a27d70d31edff20d
Signed-off-by: Your Name <committer@email.address>
```

* Submit your commit using `git review`, and mark the corresponding Jira item as `Under Review`.

```sh
$ git review
remote: Processing changes: new: 1, refs: 1, done
remote:
remote: New Changes:
remote:   http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/7915 [CE-26] Update the contribution documentation
remote:
To ssh://gerrit.hyperledger.org:29418/cello
 * [new branch]      HEAD -> refs/publish/master/CE-26
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
```

Notice you will get a [gerrit item url](http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/7915), open and check the status.

After the ci checking passed, add [reviewers](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/cello#contributors) to the reviewer list and also post the gerrit item url at the [RocketChat channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/cello). The patch will be merged into the `master` branch after passing the review, then mark the Jira item as `Done`.

* If you need to refine the patch further as the reviewers may suggest, you can change on the same branch, and commit the new code with `git commit -a --amend`, and then use the `git review` command again.
